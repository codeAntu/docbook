## 📋 Detailed Changes

### 1. **doctors** Table - SIMPLIFIED ✨

**BEFORE (Complex):**

```typescript
{
  id: uuid [PK],
  name: varchar(256),
  phone: varchar(15),
  email: varchar(256),
  about: text,
  gender: enum,
  profilePicture: varchar(512),
  qualifications: text,
  specialty: varchar(256),
  department: varchar(256),
  departmentId: uuid [FK → departments.id],
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

**AFTER (Simplified):**

```typescript
{
  doctorName: varchar(100) [PK],  // ✨ Now primary key
  specialization: varchar(256),
  contactNumber: varchar(15),
  email: varchar(256),
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

**Removed Fields:**

- ❌ `id` (UUID)
- ❌ `about`
- ❌ `gender`
- ❌ `profilePicture`
- ❌ `qualifications`
- ❌ `dateOfBirth`
- ❌ `department`
- ❌ `departmentId`
- ❌ `updatedAt`
- ❌ Relation to `departments`

### 2. **doctor_schedules** Table - ENHANCED 🔗

**ADDED:**

- ✅ Foreign key reference: `doctorName → doctors.doctorName`
- ✅ Relation to `doctor` (belongs to one)

**BEFORE:**

```typescript
doctorName: varchar(100); // Just a string
```

**AFTER:**

```typescript
doctorName: varchar(100).references(() => doctors.doctorName); // Foreign key!
```

---

### 3. **bookings** Table - IMPROVED 🎯

**CHANGED:**

- ✅ Replaced `userName: varchar(100)` with `userId: uuid [FK]`
- ✅ Added foreign key reference: `userId → users.id`
- ✅ Added relation to `user` (belongs to one)

**BEFORE:**

```typescript
{
  bookingId: serial [PK],
  scheduleId: integer [FK],
  userName: varchar(100),  // ❌ Just a string
  bookingForDate: date,
  bookingStatus: varchar(20),
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

**AFTER:**

```typescript
{
  bookingId: serial [PK],
  scheduleId: integer [FK → doctor_schedules],
  userId: uuid [FK → users],  // ✅ Proper foreign key
  bookingForDate: date,
  bookingStatus: varchar(20),
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

## 🔗 Final Schema Relationships

```
doctors (doctorName)
  ↓
  └── has many doctor_schedules
       ↓
       ├── belongs to healthcare_provider (hpName)
       └── has many bookings
            ↓
            └── belongs to user (id)

healthcare_providers (hpName)
  ↓
  └── has many doctor_schedules

users (id)
  ↓
  └── has many bookings
```
